git-go-websiteskeleton
===============
This is a very intresing games for all of you. 
A basic website skeleton in Go that comes with the Gorilla
Multiplexer for routing, glog for access and error logging, as well as jquery, bootstrap,
and font-awesome for making excellent web apps.

### You Will Need ###
1. A go environment http://golang.org/doc/install#install
2. Gorilla mux: `go get github.com/gorilla/mux` (http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux)
3. glog: `go get github.com/golang/glog`
4. Some basic knowledge of Go's httpd package. See the excellent gowiki tutorial at
http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/

### Installation ###
1. `cd $GOPATH/src`
2. `git clone https://github.com/jadekler/git-go-websiteskeleton.git`
3. `cd git-go-websiteskeleton`
4. `go run main.go`
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

Note: To make it your own project, simply remove the .git file from the project and
upload it into your own repository.

### Logging ###
This project contains access and error logging. By default, these logs will be placed in
your system's temp folder (on most *nix machines, this is `/tmp`; on mac, it's
`/private/var/gobbledegook`). To change the log dir, simply run main with
`-log_dir="/path/to/dir"`, as in `./main -log_dir="/path/to/dir"`. If you decide to
change the log location (which I recommend), you are in charge of cleaning your log dir
periodically. The program's log library (glog) will handle max file sizes, but multiple
logs will not be cleaned automatically.

Some more info on what gets captured:
- Access logging captures each request served, logging the requestor's IP, the request
method, uri, and protocol, the time
requested, and the page load time.
- Error logging captures the time, error, and a stack trace.

Note: on *nix systems, you can also set the TMPDIR environment variable to specify default
output location.
